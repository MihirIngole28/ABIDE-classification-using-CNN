The current work seeks to use deep learning algorithms to categorize Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients using the multi-site brain imaging dataset known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange). We examined Autism Spectrum Disorder patientsâ€™ brain imaging data from ABIDE, a global multi-site database. Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurological condition marked by social difficulties and repetitive activities. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have made important advances in voice recognition, picture classification, automotive Autism Spectrum Disorder software engineering, and neuroscience. This tremendous success is primarily due to a mix of algorithmic innovations, computational resource advancements, and access to a massive quantity of data. We describe the findings and highlight the regions of the brain that contributed the most to distinguishing ASD from normally developing controls using our deep learning model. The suggested CNN model does not involve feed-forward convolution; instead, we used concatenation of many convolution layers, and the whole result set obtained is sent to the multilayer perceptron (MLP) to finish classification.
